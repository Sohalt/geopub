(ns cljs-rdf.description
  "A set of triples about the same subject (idea stolen from RDF.ex)"
  (:require [cljs-rdf.core :as rdf]
            [cljs.core.logic :refer [lvar]]))

;; TODO store as hashmap from predicate to objects and increase lookup speed

;; TODO store prefixes that would allow lookups such as (get :type description) that would expand to (get (iri "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#")). Allow custom prefixes such that (get :object description) may refer to the ActivityStreams object field. This would allow very easy access to RDF data (similar to LDFlex).

;; NOTE both todos above should probably done on a more efficient graph type. A description would then just be a slice of a graph.

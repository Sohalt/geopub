#+TITLE: Clojure RDF

I intend to extract this part of GeoPub into seperate libraries:

- cljc-rdf: base protocols and data types (Clojure and ClojureScript)
- cljs-rdf-n3: bindings to N3.js
- cljs-rdf-parse: bidnings to rdf-parse.js

And then potentially there could be other bindings to Java libs (e.g. clj-rdf-jena)

Much inspiration is taken from following projects:

- [[https://github.com/marcelotto/rdf-ex][rdf-ex]]: RDF library for Elixir
- [[https://github.com/thi-ng/trio/][thi.ng/trio]]: Non-RDF triple store
- [[https://github.com/structureddynamics/clj-turtle][clj-turtle]]: A Clojure DSL to produce RDF/Turtle data.
- [[https://github.com/cordawyn/schemantic-web][schemantic-web]]: Semantic Web library for Scheme48.
- [[https://github.com/antoniogarrote/clj-plaza][clj-plaza]]

The Clojure/ClojureScipt libraries should eventually be released under the EPL
(Eclipse Public License). It is the most common license in the Clojure world and
seems to be a bit like LGPL.

#+TITLE: GeoPub

GeoPub is a content management system for [[https://miaengiadina.github.io/openengiadina/][open local knowledge]].

* Status

Currently in heavy development. Ideas on how to use an RDF graph as an underlying data model  and incorporate relational programming are being explored.

The intention is to mature the ideas into a working application.

** History

This is the third iteration of GeoPub. The initial two iterations were demonstrators:

- The initial demonstrator in JavaScript (a5c3785ed8d6a35868bc169f07e40e889087fd2e)
- The second demonstrator in ClojureScript (a5c3785ed8d6a35868bc169f07e40e889087fd2e)

* Developer quick start

See also the [[./docs/dev-notes.org][developer notes]].

** Prerequisites

- [[https://clojure.org/][Clojure]] (GeoPub is written in [[https://clojurescript.org/][ClojureScript]])

** Running development server

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
clj -m figwheel.main -b dev --repl
#+END_SRC

This will download any required dependencies, start a development server with live-reloading and a REPL.

** Building and deploying to docs folder

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
clj -m figwheel.main --optimizations advanced -bo dev
rm -r docs/
mkdir -p docs/cljs-out/
cp target/public/cljs-out/dev-main.js docs/cljs-out 
cp -r resources/public/* docs
#+END_SRC
